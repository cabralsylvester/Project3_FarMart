# FarMart

By: Eva, Fiona, Eric, & Cabral Group Project

## About App:

Farmers Markets are a wonderful place where customers can see the people who make their local products they purchase and consume. A very communal affair, vendor to customer relations are imperative to the success of these markets. FarMart is designed with both the vendors and customers in mind. This app allows vendors to post a bit about their stores and post the products they intend on bringing to the next upcoming farmers market. The customer has the ability to make reservations on the items the vendor is bringing. The customer then sets a time to pick up the order and pay in person. If the customer is a no-show, the vendor has power to contact the customer or open up the reserved items to the rest of the customers.

## Technologies Used:

Front end created with AngularJS and backend created with Rails API. Tested in Chrome browser with Chrome development tools. Bootstrap was used for our forms.

## Approach Taken:

Our approach consisted of developing and ensuring CRUD functionality for all our models in both the front and back ends. Once achieved, our goal was then to develop a user friendly app with purposeful redirects once certain actions have been taken and a well designed front end.

As a group, we initially used Trello, but moved to a traditional outline and schedule to keep on task. We used DesignApp.io to create our homepage logo. We used iMovie to create the homepage video.

## Improvements Needed:

There is still plenty of room for improvement. We would like user authentication, a consumer model, and a shopping cart model. A consumer can create and personalize an account, their reservations are inputed in their shopping cart, and then the consumer will have payment options (in person or online). Authorization so that vendors and customers have different abilities and experiences. Other small details include: a responsive quantity addition and subtraction in reservations, a notification system (vendors are notified when orders are made, edited, deleted. Customers are notified when their favorite vendors have posted.) A favorites system. A search bar function and feature.
